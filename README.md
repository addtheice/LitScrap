LitScrap
========

Literotica.com member page / story page downloading and parsing classes.

I was tired of the poor mobile site support and the inability to add some of my 
favorite longer stories to my calibre collection from this wonderful site.

So LitScrap was born. I only used it to scrap certain member pages and certain stories.

Could this be used to scrap the entire site? 

Yes. 

Will I help you write such a thing?

No.

This is purely for people who are interested in grabbing a couple stories and saving them
as single page html.

Many features are not supported because I simply didn't need them for the purposes of 
just getting a couple stories but others would need for actually scrapping:

Tags, member page name (vs just the id), category pages, etc.

This library supports grabbing member submission pages and stories, nothing more.

This library is done *as is*, I have no needs beyond the ones it fufills, so I'm not 
planning on adding any new features. I will accept updates or patches though.
